# Data-augmentation
When we don't have enough training samples to cover diverse cases in image classification, often CNN might overfit. To address this we use a technique called data augmentation in deep learning.
Data augmentation is used to generate new training samples from current training set using various transformations such as scaling, rotation, contrast change etc.
Here, I classified flower images and see how CNN model overfits. After that I used data augmentation.
